## UX
Using the app should be easy for the user. They would see the latest three 
reviews on the landing page.

The bottom right button sould make it simple for the user to add in a review.

Following step-by-step, if they need to add in new albums or artistes, the links
provided should guide and help the user.

## Technologies
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Flask
5. MySQL

## Features
In selecting the albums when the user keys in his or her review, it is a 
dropdown, form-style feature so that if the user decide to type in the value, 
the values are always accurate. The same is provided for the artist form when 
they add in a new album.

Latest 3 reviews will show up on the landing site so that the site will keep in
trend.

The search function is usable to search for albums or artistes.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using Heroku, deployed directly from the master branch.
